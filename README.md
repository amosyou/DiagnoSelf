# **slp.ai**

slp.ai helps streamline the assessment process by giving an initial screening test. This program focuses on testing elementary-aged (3-7 years old) children on their cognitive level and their ability to speak in a coherent manner. The test asks for a child to describe an image and returns a probability of how accurate the child's description is. Based on the result, a SLP can analyze whether or not further testing is necessary.
